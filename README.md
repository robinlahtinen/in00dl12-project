## About

This is a web application built to simulate an ATM using TypeScript, React, Vite, and SASS. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic ATM functions, such as withdrawing cash, checking balances, and transferring funds.

## Features

### HTML

- **Basic HTML Structure:** The web application follows a well-structured HTML format with a clear hierarchy of elements.

- **Content Differentiation:** The use of semantic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables enhances the readability and understanding of the content.

- **Forms and Links:** Forms are used for user input, enabling actions like cash withdrawal and balance checks. Links provide navigation within the application.

- **Media:** Relevant media elements, like images and icons, are utilized for a visually appealing user interface.

### CSS

- **Basic Styling:** The application is visually appealing with basic CSS styling, including color schemes and font choices.

- **Classes and IDs:** CSS classes and IDs are used to target specific elements, ensuring consistent and effective styling.

- **Responsive Design:** The web app is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Layouts:** Layouts are designed using advanced techniques like flexbox and CSS grid for complex user interfaces.

- **Aesthetics and User Experience:** The styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience, providing an engaging ATM simulation.

### JavaScript Basics

- **Simple Interactions:** Users can interact with the application, such as triggering alerts on button clicks.

- **Event Listeners:** Multiple event listeners are used for various user actions, enabling dynamic functionality.

- **Data Handling:** The application uses arrays, objects, and functions for managing user account data and transaction logic.

- **Advanced Logic:** Complex logic is employed for features like looping through data and dynamically updating the DOM in real-time.

- **Object-Oriented Principles:** The codebase adheres to object-oriented JavaScript principles for maintaining clean and organized code.

### Asynchronous Operations

- **Timers:** The application uses timers for handling time-related functionality, such as automatic logout.

- **AJAX/Fetch:** An AJAX call or Fetch is successfully implemented to fetch data, like account balances, from a remote server.

- **Data Display:** Data retrieved through asynchronous calls is displayed on the webpage, allowing users to see their account information.

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is in place to manage scenarios such as failed API calls, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Asynchronous data is effectively used for enhancing user experience, enabling features like transaction history filtering and sorting.
